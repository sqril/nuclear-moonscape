1945,Trinity Test,"On July 16, 1945, at Alamogordo, New Mexico, the world's first nuclear device was tested approximately 550 miles to the southeast of Yucca Flats. The Atomic Age was born.",
1951,First Test at NTS,"The first test at NTS was on Jan. 27, 1951. ""Able"", a 1 kiloton (kt) airdropped device, was detonated at Frenchman Flat to the southeast of Yucca Flats.",
1953,Fallout,"Above-ground tests created the greatest hazards of radioactive fallout. The radioactive cloud from test ""Simon"" met with heavy thunderstorms over upper New York State two days after its detonation forcing much of its load to fall in a limited area.",25
1955,Army Participation in Tests,"Military units were witnesses to many tests in order to study a blast's psychological impact. In 1955, troops observed test ""Turk"" from a trench as close as 5,000 yards from the blast. ",31
1957,Largest Atmospheric Test at NTS,"NTS's largest atmospheric yield of 74 kt was from device ""Hood,"" detonated to the northwest of Yucca Flats.",
1962,Largest Crater Created,"The ""Sedan"" test created the largest man-made crater in the United States with a width of 1,280 feet and a depth of 320 feet. It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",101
1970,Worst Containment Failure,"Shot ""Baneberry"" was the worst radiation containment failure for an underground test. A 6-month testing moratorium was put in place afterwards.",376
1979,Use a Nuke to Kill a Nuke,"Shot ""Hearts"" was used to destroy the nuclear device from the failed ""Transom"" test from May 1978.",501
1980,Protecting Satellites,"Shot ""Huron King"" involved placing a prototype satellite just over a shaft with a nuclear device at its bottom. The test involved letting the device's electromagnetic pulse reach the satellite, but then needing to close the shaft off before the shockwave hit the satellite and then moving it out of the way before the surface subsided.",509
1984,Unexpected Crater Collapse,"The only death directly related to a test occurred when during shot ""Midas Myth/Milagro,"" a crater collapsed unexpectedly killing one and injuring 14. The test occurred outside Yucca Flats to the northwest.",
1988,Joint Verification Experiment,"With ""Kearsharge"", both the U.S. and the Soviet Union worked together in developing methods of detecting illegal underground nuclear tests. This occurred outside the Yucca Flats area.",
1992,Last U.S. Nuclear Test,"Test ""Divider"" was the last U.S. nuclear test conducted before signing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty on September 24, 1996.",607
