Years,Description
1945 - 1949,"With the testing of ""Trinity"" on July 16, 1945, and the subsequent bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States had become a nuclear power. The need to develop additional and more refined weapons necessitated a safe and secure testing area. For many reasons, especially for logistical considerations, the testing in the Pacific at sites including Bikini Atoll convinced authorities for the need for a continental site. A panel began studying several options for its location."
1950 - 1955,"On December 18, 1950, President Truman approved the selection of southern Nevada for the establishment of the Nevada Test Site. This period saw 40 detonations in the Yucca Flats area. Initial testing was primarily weapons related, focusing on delivery systems (including artillery) and yield improvements. Between 1948 and 1952, yield results multiplied 25 times."
1956 - 1960,"Army units often participated in nuclear tests; between 1945 and 1962, the government estimates that 220,000 military and civilian personnel participated in tests in some way. In 1952, Great Britain tested its first nuclear device, followed by its first thermonuclear device in 1958. With the launching of Sputnik in 1957, the specter of missile-borne warheads was added to that of bombers and tactical weapons. In 1958, the U.S. and Great Britain agreed to joint testing at the NTS as part of the U.S-U.K. Mutual Defense Agreement."
1961 - 1965,"After a brief moratorium on testing from 1958 to 1961, the NTS saw 69 tests, the most ever performed in a single year, in 1962. Beginning in 1961, Operation Plowshare, an attempt to investigate the use of nuclear explosions for peaceful construction purposes, began. 1961 also saw the Cold War heat up with the construction of the Berlin Wall and the development by the U.S. of the Titan and Atlas Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. In October 1962, discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba lead the world to the brink of nuclear war. The following year, the U.S., Great Britain, and the Soviet Union agreed to prohibit nuclear testing in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. France and China tested their first nuclear devices in 1960 and 1964, respectively."
1966 - 1970,"Testing at the NTS continued for the purposes of yield testing and device miniaturization as development and reliance of missile delivery became more pronounced in U.S. strategic planning. Aircarft safety concerns also increased the need for improved failsafe features for the warheads. In 1967, world powers agreed to ban nuclear weapons from being placed in space. Nuclear weapons are prohibited in Latin America by the Treaty of Tlatelolco. In 1967, Israel reportedly built its first nuclear weapon. The next year, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was signed by the U.S., Soviet Union, and Great Britain. China tested its first thermonuclear device in 1967, as did France in 1968."
1971 - 1975,"The U.S. and Soviet Union joined 46 other nations in 1970 and agreed to work together to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons. In 1972, the U.S. and U.S.S.R signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I) wherein the nations agreed not to deploy nationwide defenses against strategic ballistic missiles. The hope was that limiting defensive capabilities would curb the need for deploying more strategic offensive arms. In 1973, Operation Plowshare ended after 27 nuclear and additional non-nuclear tests. In 1974, the U.S. and Soviet Union signed protocols limiting tests to 150 kt, as well as further reducing the number of anti-ballistic missle sites. India also conducts its first nuclear test."
1976 - 1980,"In 1976, the U.S. and Soviet Union agreed to limitations on underground testing for peaceful purposes. The following year, international standards were establishmed for safeguards and other standards for the export and transfer of nuclear materials. In 1979, SALT II was signed, limiting the number of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles as well as MIRV and cruise missiles, but never went into force. 1979 also saw South Africa build but not test its first nuclear weapon."
1981 - 1985,"President Reagan initiated numerous missions that began a massive military build-up of conventional and nuclear forces. In 1983, the Strategic Defense Initiative began in an effort to protect the U.S. and its allies from Soviet strategic nuclear weapons."
1986 - 1990,"Meeting in 1986 in Reykjavik, world powers opened talks to discuss the elimination of all ballistic missiles, but no agreement can be reached. In 1987, the U.S. and the Soviet Union do reach agreement on intermediate and short range missiles and sign the INF Treaty. On Nov. 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall came down."
1991 - 1995,"The early '90s saw the U.S. and the Soviet Union (and its successor the Russian Federation) negotiate treaties to reduce stockpiles of warheads. Since the moratorium on nuclear testing in 1992, the NTS has diversified into non-nuclear areas while not only remaining ready to resume tests if needed but developing the means to ensure compliance with international non-proliferation agreements. In 1990, Congress passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which provided partial restitution to government, civilian, and military persons who contracted cancers or other serious diseases because of the nuclear testing program. To date over 40,000 claimants have had a total of nearly $2 billion dollars disbursed to them."
